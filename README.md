# Tic-tac-toe Reinforcement Learning contest

When learning how to build up Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, it is good to compare to others on well-known tasks. Here, you may propose your own algorithms and strategies and compare them with dummy algorithms, humans, or other algorithms. The package makes it easy to build up a leaderboard of many players/algorithms.

## How to install?

Install necessary packages by running this in a terminal (if you do not know `poetry`, see how to install [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)):
```shell
poetry install
```

## How to run?

You can try it out-of-the-box by running this in a terminal:
```shell
# enters poetry virtual environment
poetry shell

# runs contest (dummy vs dummy - dummy plays at random)
python tictactoe.py play --player1=dummy --player2=dummy
```

By default, `python tictactoe.py play` runs 1000 games of tic-tac-toe. Player 1 starts for the 500 firsts, and player 2 does for the remaining. This command returns global results.

## Available algorithms

You may currently try out-of-the-box:
* `dummy` which plays at random,
* `smart_start` which plays at random except for its first move for which he (tries to) play the center mark.

## How to play against an algorithm?

There is `--player1=me` option (or `--player2=me`). Just do not forget to change the default number of plays (which is `1000`):
```shell
python tictactoe.py play --player1=dummy --player2=me --nb_plays=1
```

## Adding your own strategy/algorithm

If you want to enter the contest, you just need to add your player to the `players` subfolder. This project is primarily designed towards value function-oriented and Q-learning algorithms. Therefore, say your name is Mark, you simply need to add to the `players` subfolder a `mark.json` file containing:
```json
{
    "type": "Q",
    "data": {
        "---------": {
            "1": 0.2,
            "2": 0.3,
            "4": 0.5,
            "5": 1,
            "6": 0.7,
            "7": 0.2,
            "8": 0.2,
            "9": 0.4
        },
        ...
    }
}
```

And run:
```shell
python tictactoe.py play --player1=mark
```

:warning: Note that since dictionaries keys must be strings, you need to provide action indices as such.

Now, it is very important to understand this format, especially the `"data"` part: for any possible tic-tac-toe state (`"---------"` in the example, meaning an empty board, at the very start of the game), it gives you the expected future value of any action. Actions range from 1 to 9. Action 1 means placing a mark in the upper-left corner of the board, and then it goes right and down: action 4, for instance, means placing a mark at the left side of the middle row.
Using the `"type"` argument, you may specify a state value function (V) or a state-action value function (Q).

## Adding a custom strategy

If you want to add a strategy that does not rely on value functions, well, wait a little...

## Computing leaderboard

As soon as you have a few strategies in the `players` subfolder, you may want to compare them at once. Simply do the following:
```shell
# if not already in the virtual environment
poetry shell

# runs all play combinations and shows leaderboard
python tictactoe.py board
```
